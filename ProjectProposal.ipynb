    "\n",
    "The dataset we are using is a [Spotify track dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks) from Kaggle that contains attributes such as popularity (which we are planning on classifying), danceability, duration_ms, artists, explicit, energy, release_date, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[We are planning on using the attributes mentioned above to help classify how popular a track is.]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation and Technical Aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "While processing this dataset we expect to have to remove instances of []. We plan to possibly filter our instances by release date [and use post 2000 music] because the style of music has changed and therefore, the popular music has changed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Impact of the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "These results can be used my artists, producers, and streaming platforms. Artists and producers can use this data to decide what singles to release and promote in order to save time and money. Streaming platforms such as Spotify can use these results to make better recommendations to users and more accurately depict what songs will be trending. \n",
