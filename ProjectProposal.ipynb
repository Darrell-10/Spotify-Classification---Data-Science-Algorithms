    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are using is a [Spotify track dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks) from Kaggle that contains attributes such as popularity (which we are planning on classifying), danceability, duration_ms, artists, explicit, energy, release_date, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[We are planning on using the attributes mentioned above to help classify how popular a track is.]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation and Technical Aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "While processing this dataset we expect to have to remove instances of []. We plan to filter our instances by release date [and use post 2000 music] because the style of music has changed and therefore, the popular music has changed as well. Because most songs tend to have low popularity, we plan to use binning to categorize popularity into groups such as highly popular, popular, and unpopular in order to create balances classes. Regarding feature selection we plan to use a tree based model such as Random Forest to extract the importance of specific features. \n",

    "## Potential Impact of the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "These results can be used by artists, producers, and streaming platforms. Artists and producers can use these findings to decide what singles to release and promote in order to save time and money. Streaming platforms such as Spotify can use these results to make better recommendations to users and more accurately depict what songs will be trending. Users will also have a more pleasant experience it will make it easier for them to discover songs they are interested in.\n",
