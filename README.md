## Overall Project
We decided to try and predict Spotify track popularity using four different classifiers.  
These are described in more depth within the file `TechnicalReport.ipynb`.

## Project Setup
Our project is layed out within the file `TechnicalReport.ipynb`. It start with an introduction, shows some figures, goes into Data Analysis,  
Classification results, more figures, followed by a conclusion and acknowledgements.

## Jupyter Notebooks
We used the `Run All` Jupyter Notebook GUI tool to run our cells. Alternatively, you could use `Ctrl + Enter` to run each cell individually.

Note: we performed our classifications in their own Jupyter notebooks then manually transfered the results to avoid clutter.
